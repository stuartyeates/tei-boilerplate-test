tei-boilerplate-test
====================

This is a test repository to see whether TEI Boilerplate and github
could be use to view, edit and archive ones XML, all in the same 
place. 

I'm currently floundering on the fact that github (and git in general) 
does not do mimetypes at all so while editing works fine, the XML is 
served to browsers as text/plain, the browser doesn't treat the XML as 
as XML and the processing instructions are never triggered. For
details of this shortcoming see:
